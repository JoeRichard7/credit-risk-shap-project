Local SHAP Explanations — Textual Transcriptions

1. HIGH-RISK BORROWER – Local SHAP Explanation
Model Decision Summary:
The model predicted a high likelihood of default for this borrower. SHAP values show multiple features pushing risk upward.

Key Feature Contributions:
- High Current Debt Burden: Increases pressure on repayment capacity.
- Low Monthly Income: Reduces financial buffer.
- High Credit Utilization Ratio: Suggests dependency on credit.
- Short Credit History Length: Increases uncertainty.
Minor protective factors slightly reduce risk but not enough to counter the major risks.

2. LOW-RISK BORROWER – Local SHAP Explanation
Model Decision Summary:
Prediction is well below baseline risk. SHAP values mainly pull downward.

Key Feature Contributions:
- High Monthly Income: Strong stabilizing factor.
- Low Outstanding Debt: Reflects financial discipline.
- Low Credit Utilization: Indicates healthy credit behavior.
- Long Credit History: Demonstrates reliability.
Minor upward forces exist but are negligible.

3. BORDERLINE / AMBIGUOUS CASE – Local SHAP Explanation
Model Decision Summary:
Borrower is near threshold. SHAP shows mixed contributions.

Key Feature Contributions:
- Moderate Income: Slightly reduces risk.
- Medium-High Debt Burden: Pushes risk upward.
- Recent Delinquencies: Major risk driver.
- Average Utilization: Neutral.
- Recent Credit Inquiries: Slight risk increase.
Some stabilizing factors help counterbalance these.
