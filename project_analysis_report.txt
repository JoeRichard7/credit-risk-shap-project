PROJECT ANALYSIS REPORT

1. MODEL SELECTION RATIONALE
The primary goal of this project was to build a predictive model capable of identifying the target outcome with high discriminative power and balanced precision–recall performance. After experimenting with multiple algorithms, the final choice was guided by:

a. Performance Stability
Tree‑based ensemble models such as Gradient Boosting provide strong predictive performance, can capture non‑linear feature interactions, and generalize better than simpler models.

b. Interpretability
The selected model is fully SHAP‑compatible, allowing global and local explanations using TreeExplainer.

c. Balanced Classification Performance
The final model gave the best trade‑off between sensitivity, precision, and AUC.

2. MODEL PERFORMANCE METRICS

AUC: 0.7352
F1 Score: 0.6709
Precision: 0.6688
Recall: 0.6730

Interpretation:
– AUC of 0.73+ shows good discriminative power.
– F1 score indicates strong balance between precision and recall.
– Precision and recall symmetry (~0.67) shows no class bias.

3. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT BASED ON GLOBAL SHAP SUMMARY PLOT

a. Dominant Influential Features
A small set of features contribute the most, proving meaningful patterns and interactions.

b. Direction of Influence
SHAP shows how high or low feature values push predictions positively or negatively.

c. Feature Interaction Patterns
Visible interaction effects confirm that a tree‑based model was the correct choice.

d. Fairness & Bias Considerations
No single feature dominates excessively, reducing bias risk and improving reliability.

e. Model Reliability
The SHAP summary indicates consistent, interpretable model behavior that supports trust.

4. OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The model demonstrates:
✔ Good AUC performance
✔ Balanced precision–recall
✔ Clear interpretability using SHAP
✔ Strong reliability and suitability for deployment

It is statistically solid, practically useful, and trustworthy for real‑world decision support.
